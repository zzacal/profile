### Building and running your application

When you're ready, start your application by running:
`docker compose up --build`.

Your application will be available at http://localhost:8113.

Consult Docker's [getting started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/04_sharing_app/)
docs for more detail on building and pushing.
